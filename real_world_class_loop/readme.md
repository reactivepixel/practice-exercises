`Challenge 1`

```
For this exercise the employee class will have the following as properties, name, employer, occupation, hourlyRate, hoursWorked. The constructor should ask for name.

1.	Create the employee class.
2.	Make an instance of the class.
3.	Display the employee(instance of the class).
```

`Challenge 2`

```
The second exercise for this project is to define three occupations, and their
hourlyRates.This could be anything from cashier, stocker, or office assistant.It can be
anything you want really.The same applies for the hourly rates and employers.Modify the constructor to accept a name, employer, and occupation.

1.	Modify the constructor to accept a name, employer, and occupation.
2.	Based on the input occupation please set the hourlyRate.
3.	Create an instance of the class.
4.	Display the employee.
```

`Challenge 3`

```
The next exercise would be to create a loop prompting the user for how many employees they would like create.

1.	Move logic around to fit in a loop
2.	Prompt user for a number of employees.
3.	Prompt the user for an employee name, employer name, occupation, and hourly rate.
4.	Display all the employees. 
```

`Challenge 4`

```
The following exercise will have you create two new properties for the employee class. weeklyPay, and yearlyPay.You will need to create a method to calculate 
these values and set the properties when the constructor is called.

1.	Alter the constructor to accept a value for hoursWorked
2.	Create a method to calculate the weeklyPay and yearlyPay. (Assume that the employee will get the same amount of hours each week for the yearlyPay).
3.	Call this method in the constructor to set the values when the employee is calculated.
4.	Display all the employees.
```
